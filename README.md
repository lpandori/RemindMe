# RemindMe
CS121 Semester Project
Our team developed an app that allows users to set multiple different time frequencies under a single alarm. 
For instance, if someone has to take antibiotics, often the pattern for taking medication is more complicated
than a simple daily alarm at 3:30pm or Mondays and Wednesdays at 3:00 pm. Instead, the pattern might be:
Monday and Wednesdays at 10:00 am and 5:00 pm and Tuesdays and Thursdays at 12:00 pm. 
Rather than of having to set four separate alarms for each time frequency, our app allows users to set a
single alarm with this complexity. With the RemindMe app a user can add a combination of one-time, daily, weekly,
and monthly reminders under a single alarm. Furthermore, our app allows users to set customizable snooze times
for each alarm they create. 

Users can ... 
  -make a new alarm
  -add multiple reminder times to an alarm
  -edit reminder times
  -enable/disable alarm
  -snooze an alarm
  -dismiss an alarm
